# datasciencecoursera

this is Edgar Scott's homework

* git init -- initilizes a git repository on your machine
* git remote add origin https://github.com/iamarf/datasciencecoursera -- I forget what this does
* git add . -- adds everything that is "new" to a list of soon-to-be-committed files
* git commit -a -- commits everything set to be committed
* git push -u origin master -- sync your git repository on your desktop with your github account
* git commit -m -- I forget what this does
